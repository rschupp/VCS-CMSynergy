VCS::CMSynergy::Changes - List of changes to VCS::CMSynergy

=cut

Known problems:

- shorthand query notation lacks documentation

- get rid of mkInstallation:
  replace this *class* with a "CCM (client) installation" *object*

- IPC::Open3 croaks on NT if stdout or stderr is closed on entry
  reason is probably that perl opens the script file read-only and it gets
  file descriptor 1 or 2 resp. 

- 'make test' on Windows with out-of-the-box CM Synergy installation:
   probably needs to specify -u and -home options for "ccm start"

=head1 CHANGES

=head2 Changes in Version 1.14

  Implement tied hash interface for VCS::CMSynergy::Object.
  Now you can get/set attributes by treating an V::C::Object like a hash.
  Since this requires every V::C::Object to hold a reference to the sesssion,
  this is only available if Scalar::Util is detected at runtime (so we
  can weaken the referemce).

=head2 Changes in Version 1.13 (not released)

  Implement get_releases()/set_releases() for manipulating the release table.
  Implement property().

  Fix 'ye olde text_editor trick on Windows (checked on NT 4.0 and XP):
  CM Synergy seems unable to execute "shell" builtins (like "copy"),
  use "xcopy" instead.

  Make VCS::CMSynergy work on cygwin (even UseCoprocess works).
  This requires Filesys::CygwinPaths to translate Cygwin path names 
  (e.g. as returned by File::Temp::tempfile()) to Windows path names.

  Changed record/field separators (used internally by query/finduse/history)
  from \cD/\cG to \cA/\cD, but someone will probably succeed in
  entering these into some attribute. Anyway, avoid \x1C-\x1E as
  they are used by Change Synergy in some attribute of "problem".

  Add a hint on the usage of new(ui_database_dir => ...).
  Merge pod entries for query_arrayref/query_hashref and 
  history_arrayref/history_hashref.

  Fix brown paper bag errors in set_attribute (wrong usage check)
  and set_error (handling of HandleError).

=head2 Changes in Version 1.12

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: attribute() has been replaced by two methods 
  get_attribute() and set_attribute().
  attributes() has been renamed to list_attributes().

  Move VCS::CMSynergy hash keys CCM_HOME, CCM_ADDR and CCM_INI_FILE
  into sub hash env. Change ccmexec to pass it a hash ref with keys/values
  to temporarily add to %ENV instead of passing CCM_HOME.
  Factor ccm() into _ccm() (does all the work except error handling) and
  make ccm() a simple wrapper for it. Get rid of IgnoreError and
  use _ccm for all "internal" calls.
  Document "HandleError" and set_errror().
  Pod: change all method "=item"s to "=head2"; the man page looks slightly
  worse, but the HTML rendering is much better.
  CMSynergy/users.pl: renamed to CMSynergy/update_users.pm.
  Implemented create_attribute(), delete_attribute(), and copy_attribute().

=head2 Changes in Version 1.10

  Document types of options for new().
  Document option `KeepSession' for new().
  Mention correct way to explicity stop a session.
  Implement ccm_addr().
  Make database() lazy.

=head2 Changes in Version 1.09 (not released)

  Make it work for ancient Continuus 4.5 (fixes #1681):
    - `ccm ps -rfc_address ADDR' doesn't find the process if host part of ADDR
       is given as name (instead of an IP address); esp. this breaks
       `ccm ps -rfc_address $ccm->{CCM_ADDR}' - used in new()
    - different error messages from `ccm finduse' if object is not in use
    - adjust test cases
  Correctly handle (Raise|Print|Handle)Error when ps() in new() fails.
  Add 'remote_client => 1' to options for new() (causes `-rc' for `ccm start').

=head2 Changes in Version 1.08

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The pseudo keyword "finduse" in query_arrayref()
    and query_hashref() does not return a list of project references
    any more. It now returns a hash which maps proj_vers to relative_path. 
    Similarly, the rows returned by finduse() have changed from
    	[ $description, @project_references ]
    to
    	[ $description, \%usage_map ].

  Converted findpath() to use new finduse(), adjusted t/04finduse.t.
  Convert tests to use Test::More.
  Makefile.PL: don't require Memoize anymore, just recommend it.
  Windows: will sleep(2) _after_ "ccm stop" and _before_ unlinking 
    files_to_unlink (because they may still be "busy" - probably "ccm stop"
    returns _before_ CM Synergy really has ceased operation).
  Fix problem with set_error() that's probably a perl bug 
    (at least for 5.6.1, fixed in 5.8.1, cf #9998, #9739 on rt.perl.org):

      sub foo
      {
	 my @x = (2, 1, 0);	# last elem must be false
	 return @x if wantarray and @x;
	 print "OOPS\n";
      }
      my @foo = foo;

    This will print "OOPS". Somehow wantarray seems to force list context
    onto the right-hand side of "and" - @x will thus evaluate to its
    last element.

=head2 Changes in Version 1.07

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The 3-arg form of attribute() does not return
    the old value any more.

  Document 3-arg form of attribute().
  When setting attributes, cope with arbitrary types by looking
    up the super_type recursively until one of the well known types 
    (for which we "just know" whether they need the "text_editor"
    trick )is found.
  Kludge for annoying `Security violation...' warning on Windows
    (thanks to Peter Kreuz for the explanation what's goin' on).
  Rewritten output parsing for history_*().
  Fix typo in types().
  Add error() and ccm_command() calss/instance methods, prefer
    them in docs over explicit $ccm->{error} or $VCS::CMSynergy::error.
  Add "ui_database_dir" option to new().
 
=head2 Version 1.05

  The Great Renaming: s/CMSyngery/VCS::CMSynergy/g.
  First version uploaded to CPAN.

=head2 Version 1.04

  Split out CMSynergy::Users.pm.
  Fix bug with multi-line valued attributes in query_* functions.
  Rewritten output parsing for query_*() and finduse().
  Make "ccm->set('foo', undef) " execute "ccm unset foo".
  Fix bug reported by Jürgen Schorer: CCM_HOME not passed down to "ccm start".
  Rewritten test cases.
  Make tests work under NT and Cygwin.
  Split out (and currently don't distribute) CMSynergy::Traversal.pm.

=head2 Version 1.02

  Fill $VERSION from CM Synergy version.
  Add LICENSE in preparation for CPAN upload.

=head2 Version 1.01

  Fix exit code of ccm() when using coprocess.

=head2 Version 1.00

  "ccm ps" can't be called interactively.
  Make set_error callable as class method.
  Convenience function: CMObject::proj_vers.

=head2 Version 0.98

  Downgrade required Perl version  to 5.6.0 (untested).
  Use Memoize.pm if available, otherwise memoization is a no-op.

=head2 Version 0.97

  Fix problems when outer SIGCHLD handler is present.
