  old_project, new_project
              project specs, either in the form "proj_vers"

  --ui_database_dir PATH          path to copy database information to

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<ccm_project_diff> shows the differences between two projects
in terms of the workarea paths of the projects' members.
It does I<not> need maintained workareas, though.

=head2 C<--terse> listing (default)

C<ccm_project_diff> traverses both projects and outputs the differences in the
following form:

  a toolkit-1.0:project:1 2002-11-26 23:26:36     released
  b toolkit-darcy:project:1       2002-12-17 01:46:21     working
  ! toolkit/editor/sources/main.c main.c-1:csrc:2 main.c-2:csrc:2
  + toolkit/guilib/includes/fonts.h fonts.h-1:incl:1
  ! toolkit/guilib/makefile makefile-1:makefile:3 makefile-2:makefile:3
  + toolkit/guilib/sources/fonts.c fonts.c-1:csrc:1
  ! toolkit/misc/readme readme-1:ascii:1 readme-2:ascii:1
  ...

After the two header lines showing information about the projects,
lines start with one of C<+>, C<->, C<!>, or C<~> 
followed by the workarea pathname
of the object in the project, followed by additional information
(separated by tabs):

=over 4

=item C<+>

marks a path added in new_project; 
the correponding objectname is given as additional info

=item C<->

marks a path deleted from old_project;
the correponding objectname is given as additional info

=item C<!>

marks a path where the corresponding objects have different versions
in old_project and new_project;
the objectnames are given as additional info

=item C<~>

marks a path where the corresponding objects are of different "lineage":
either different instances
(e.g. object was deleted and a new object created with the same name)
or a different cvtype 
(e.g. a  directory was replaced by a regular file);
the objectnames are given as additional info

=back

All objects in an added/deleted subtree are shown. This can be suppressed
with option C<--hide> which will only show the root of such a subtree.

=head2 C<--diff> listing

With this option the output resembles that of B<diff -ur>:

  synergy a: toolkit-1.0:project:1	Tue Nov 26 23:26:36 2002
  synergy b: toolkit-darcy:project:1	Tue Dec 17 01:46:21 2002

   INCLUDE_DIR =	includes
   
   OBJ_FILES = 	$(SOURCE_DIR)/main.o \

   INCLUDES =		-I$(INCLUDE_DIR)
   OPT_CFLAGS =	-g
  ...

Files that are only present in one project are indicated
by "Only in a: ..." or "Only in b: ..." lines.
An object that changes cvtype from "dir" to non-"dir" or vice versa is
indicated by a line of the form:

  File a/foo is a regular file while file b/foo is a directory

Differences in directories (i.e. both objects are of 
cvtype "dir", but different versions) are not shown.

Additional CM Synergy information (objectname, modified_time)
is given by lines starting with "synergy a:" or "synergy b:"
immediately following any of the above "header" lines.

Note that C<--diff> implies C<--hide> (the top of a added/deleted
subtree is still indicated by a "Only in ..." line).

=head2 C<--patch> listing

With this option the output resembles that of B<diff -urN>.
This is the same as C<--diff> output except that "absent" objects are
treated as empty files and added/deleted subtrees are not hidden.
This listing is suitable to "patch up" a checked out I<old_project> 
to a copy of I<new_project> with the command:

  patch -p1 -E < project.patch

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 C<-r>, C<--recursive>

Traverse also subprojects.

=head2 C<-h>, C<--hide>

Hide added/deleted subtrees in C<--terse> output format.

=head2 SYNERGY OPTIONS

See L<VCS::CMSynergy::Helper/GetOptions>.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Exit status is 0 if the projects are identical, 1 if some differences
were found, 2 if some error occurred.
