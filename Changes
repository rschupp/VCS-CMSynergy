Version 1.07

    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The 3-arg form of attribute() does not return
      the old value any more.

    Document 3-arg form of attribute().
    When setting attributes, cope with arbitrary types by looking
      up the super_type recursively until one of the well known types 
      (for which we "just know" whether they need the "text_editor"
      trick )is found.
    Kludge for annoying `Security violation...' warning on Windows
      (thanks to Peter Kreuz for the explanation what's goin' on).
    Rewritten output parsing for history_*().
    Fix typo in types().
    Add error() and ccm_command() calss/instance methods, prefer
      them in docs over explicit $ccm->{error} or $VCS::CMSynergy::error.
    Add "ui_database_dir" option to new().
