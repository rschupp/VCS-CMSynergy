VCS::CMSynergy -- Perl interface to Telelogic Synergy

This module is a Perl interface to IBM Rational Synergy (at various
times also known as Continuus/CM, CM Synergy or Teleogic SYNERGY/CM),
a change and configuration management system from IBM.
It is implemented on top of the Synergy CLI,
hence you must have the command line client ("ccm") installed to use it.

BUILDING

Unpack the distribution, change to its top level directory, and then

    perl Makefile.PL
    make

On Win32 systems, replace "make" in the commands with "nmake". 
The nmake utility is included in Microsoft Visual Studio products.
An older version can be downloaded from 
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe

TESTING

Make sure that the Synergy command client is installed and working:

  - check your setting of the CCM_HOME environment variable
  - test the installation with

    $CCM_HOME/bin/ccm version

Run the tests with

    make test

If everything looks OK, install the module with

    make install
