This module is a Perl interface to CM Synergy (formerly known as
Continuus CM), a change and configuration management system 
from Telelogic AB (http://www.telelogic.com).  It is implemented
on top of the CM Synergy CLI, hence you must have the command client ("ccm")
installed to use it.

VCS::CMSynergy.pm has been tested in the following environments:

Client (where the Perl script runs)	CM Synergy server
OS, Perl version			OS, CM Synergy version
-----------------------------------	---------------------------

Solaris 2.6, Perl 5.6.1                 Solaris 2.6, CM Synergy 5.1

Solaris 2.8, Perl 5.6.1                 Solaris 2.8, CM Synergy 6.2

Linux 2.4, Perl 5.8.0                   Linux 2.4, CM Synergy 6.2

Windows XP, ActiveState Perl 5.6.1	Solaris 2.8, CM Synergy 6.2

Windows XP, Cygwin Perl 5.8.0		Solaris 2.8, CM Synergy 6.2


BUILDING

Unpack the distribution, change to its top level directory, and then

    perl Makefile.PL
    make


TESTING

Make sure that the CM Synergy command client is installed and working:

  - check your setting of the CCM_HOME environment variable
  - test the installation with

    $CCM_HOME/bin/ccm version

You will need a pristine copy of the "tutorial" database to test the
module. The pack file for the "tutorial" database is distributed with
the CM Synergy product and is located in $CCM_HOME/packfiles/tutorial.cpk. 
Have your friendly CM Synergy administrator create a test database,
say /ccmdb/test_module, by executing

    $CCM_HOME/bin/ccmdb_unpack $CCM_HOME/packfiles/tutorial.cpk /ccmdb/test_module

and have her add you as a user to this database, currently the "developer"
role is sufficient to run the tests. Set the environemnt variable
CCM_TEST_DB to the name of the test database, e.g. (in Bourne shell syntax)

    CCM_TEST_DB=/ccmdb/test_module; export CCM_TEST_DB

If you are testing on Windows, you must also set the environment
variable CCM_TEST_USER to "user/password@host" which correspond
to the "ccm" options "-n", "-pw", and "-h", resp.
Run the tests with

    make test

If everything looks OK, install the module with

    make install
