This synopsis only lists the major methods.

Methods that don't need a CM Synergy session are described
in L<VCS::CMSynergy::Client>. In fact, C<VCS::CMSynergy>
is derived from C<VCS::CMSynergy::Client>.

Methods for administering users and their roles are
described in L<VCS::CMSynergy::Users>. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  use VCS::CMSynergy;

  my $ccm = VCS::CMSynergy->new(database => "/ccmdb/test/tut62/db");

  $ccm->checkout(qw(foo/bar.c@foo~user -to test))
    or die "checkout failed: ".$ccm->error;

  my $csrcs = $ccm->query_hashref("type = 'csrc'",
				  qw(displayname modify_time));
  if ($csrcs)
  {
    print "$_->{displayname} $_->{modify_time}\n" foreach (@$csrcs);
  }

=head1 OPTIONS

The following optional features can be enabled at compile time
with the notation

  use VCS::CMSynergy ':option';

=head2 :cached_attributes

This causes L<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s to keep a cache of 
attribute names and values. The cache is only maintained for those
attributes that are actually accessed by the program. See
L<VCS::CMSynergy::Object/ATTRIBUTE METHODS> for a list of
methods perusing this cache.

Note that this cache
is only maintained if you use L<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> methods
(including the L<VCS::CMSynergy::Object/TIEHASH INTERFACE>) 
and will get inconsistent if you
mix C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> and C<VCS::CMSynergy> calls
on the same object.

=head2 :tied_objects

If this option is in effect.
you can use a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> in the same way you
would use a hash reference. The available keys are the underlying
CM Synergy object's attributes. 
See L<VCS::CMSynergy::Object/TIEHASH INTERFACE> for details.

=head1 GENERAL METHODS

=head2 new

  my $ccm = VCS::CMSynergy->new( database => "/ccmdb/foo/db" )
              or die VCS::CMSynergy->error;

Starts a new CM Synergy session. Returns a session handle if it succeeds. 

If it fails to start a session, it returns C<undef>. Use
C<< VCS::CMSynergy->error >> to get the error string printed by CM Synergy.

Multiple simultaneous sessions to multiple databases or with
engines running on different hosts, even using different versions
of CM Synergy, are supported.

C<new> issues a B<ccm start> command and remembers the C<CCM_ADDR>
in the session object (together with other session state).
The session is stopped (B<ccm stop>) when the session object
is destroyed (see L</DESTROY>).

C<new> is called with an attribute hash. The following attributes
are currently supported:

=over 4

=item C<database> (string)

CM Synergy database path. 

This is the only attribute required on Unix systems.

=item C<host> (string)

CM Synergy engine host to use.

It defaults to the local host.

=item C<role> (string)

User's initial CM Synergy role.

It defaults to C<developer>.

=item C<user> (string)

CM Synergy user. 

This attribute is available and required on Windows systems only.

=item C<password> (string)

User's password. 

This attribute is required on Windows systems or when using
ESD to connect to the CM Synergy engine.

=item C<ini_file> (string)

CM Synergy ini file to use. 

In contrast to the CM Synergy B<ccm start> command there is I<no>
default ini file consulted. (On Unix systems this is achieved
by executing B<ccm start> with the option C<-f /dev/null>.) The reason
is that we want scripts to behave in a reproducible way. Otherwise
the script might accidentally work with the current contents of
the current user's ini file, but might fail when invoked by another user.
Or it might fail when invoked by the same user at a later time because of
changes to her ini file (e.g. because of another session between
invocations of the script). So if you really want to rely on an ini file,
you have to supply it explicitly.

=item C<CCM_ADDR> (string)

Specifies the RFC address of an established CM Synergy session.

If you specify this attribut L</new> does not create a new session,
but will attach to the one specified. Also, implicitly sets C<KeepSession>
to true so that destruction of the new session
handle will not cause a B<ccm stop>. However, setting C<KeepSession> 
explicitly will take precedence.

Note that there is no default value. In particular, L</new> ignores
the environment variable of the same name.

=item C<CCM_HOME> (string)

Value of the C<CCM_HOME> environment variable to use for this session.

It defaults from the environment variable of the same name,
i.e. C<$ENV{CCM_HOME}>.

This is only of interest if you have multiple version of CM Synergy
installed. You can have simultaneous sessions using different
CM Synergy versions (the module takes care of setting the C<CCM_HOME>
variable appropriately before issuing any C<ccm> commands). 

=item C<ui_database_dir> (string)

Specifies the path name to which your database information is copied 
when you are running a remote client session. This corresponds
to the C<-u pathname> option for B<ccm start>.

Note: This option is particularly useful for Windows clients. If L</new>
fails with something like 

  Server Database Path ... is not accessible from this Client.   
  Please specify a Client Database Path

you should specify this option with a local directory path, e.g.

  my $ccm = VCS::CMSynergy->new(..., ui_database_dir => 'c:\\temp', ...);

The value is  what you would enter under 
"Client Information"/"Database Path" in the GUI's "Startup Info" window.
Or you can set B<ui_database_dir> in the [Options] section of 
the system ini file (note that setting it in your personal ini file
won't do, as this file is I<not> read by L</new> by default).

=item C<remote_client> (boolean)

If the value is true, it specifies that you want to start the CM Synergy
session as a remote client. This corresponds to the C<-rc> option for
B<ccm start>. This option is only useful on Unix systems. It defaults
to false.

=item C<PrintError> (boolean)

This attribute can be used to force errors to generate warnings (using
L<carp|Carp/carp>) in addition to returning error codes in the normal way.  
When set to true, any method which results in an error occuring will cause
the corresponding C<< $ccm->error >> to be printed to stderr.

It defaults to true.

Note: L</PrintError> and L</RaiseError> below are stolen from the excellent
L<DBI> module.

=item C<RaiseError> (boolean)

This attribute can be used to force errors to raise exceptions 
(using L<croak|Carp/croak>) rather than simply return error codes in the normal way. 
When set to true, any method which results in an error will cause
effectively a C<die> with the actual C<< $ccm->error >>
as the message. 

It defaults to false.

If you turn C<RaiseError> on then you'd normally turn C<PrintError> off.
If C<PrintError> is also on, then the C<PrintError> is done first (naturally).

Typically C<RaiseError> is used in conjunction with C<eval { ... }>
to catch the exception that's been thrown and followed by an
C<if ($@) { ... }> block to handle the caught exception. 

If you want to temporarily turn C<RaiseError> off (inside a library function
that is likely to fail, for example), the recommended way is like this:

  {
    local $ccm->{RaiseError};  # localize and turn off for this block
    ...
  }

The original value will automatically and reliably be restored by Perl,
regardless of how the block is exited.
The same logic applies to other attributes, including C<PrintError>.

=item C<HandleError> (code ref)

This attribute can be used to provide your own
alternative behaviour in case of errors. If set to a
reference to a subroutine then that subroutine is called
when an error is detected (at the same point that
L</RaiseError> and L</PrintError> are handled).

The subroutine is called with three parameters: the
error message string that L</RaiseError> and L</PrintError>
would use, the C<VCS::CMSynergy> object being used, and the 
value being returned by the method that failed (typically undef).

If the subroutine returns a false value then the
L</RaiseError> and/or L</PrintError> attributes are checked
and acted upon as normal. Otherwise the error is considered "handled"
and execution proceeds normally with a return from the method.

For example, to "die" with a full stack trace for any error:

  use Carp;
  $ccm->{HandleError} = sub { confess(shift) };

=item C<KeepSession> (boolean)

If this attribute is true then destruction of the new session handle
will not cause a B<ccm stop>. 

This may be used if you want to
create a new CM Synergy session in one program and then re-use it
in another program (since session creation is a rather time consuming
operation). In this case you should use C</ccm_addr> to extract
the session's RFC address (after C</new> returns) and somehow pass it
on to the other program.

It defaults to false unless you also specify C<CCM_ADDR>.

=item C<UseCoprocess> (boolean)

This feature is highly experimental, B<use it at your own risk>.

B<You must have the L<Expect> module installed to use this feature.>
(Since L<Expect> is not available for Win32 systems, 
C<UseCoprocess> is ignored there.)

If C<UseCoprocess> is false, C<VCS::CMSynergy.pm> executes a separate
C<ccm> process whenever it invokes the CM Synergy CLI, e.g.

  $ccm->checkout('foo.c');
  $ccm->set_attribute('color', 'foo.c', 'blue');
  $csources = $ccm->query("name match '*.c'");

results in the execution of the following three processes:

  ccm checkout foo.c
  ccm attribute -modify color -value blue foo.c
  ccm query "name match '*.c'"

In particular, we incur the startup overhead of B<ccm> three times.
This overhead is noticable, esp. if you are doing 
lots of CM Synergy operations.

If C<UseCoprocess> is true, only one B<ccm> process per CM Synergy
session ever gets executed. The way it works is that
C<< VCS::CMSynergy->new >> starts an "interactive"
(i.e. one invoked without arguments) B<ccm> process in the background.
Later invocations of the CM Synergy CLI pipe their commands to its input and 
read back the output (up to the next C<< "ccm>" >> prompt). 
The actual command is then followed in the same way by C<set error>
to retrieve the success status. Destruction  of the session object
will cause termination of this "coprocess" (via "stop" or "exit" depending
on the setting of L</KeepSession>).

The "coprocess" method avoids the startup overhead, but may run into 
other problems:

=over 4

=item *

The "interactive" B<ccm> imposes stricter limits 
on the length of one CLI command (experimentally put at ~2000 bytes)
than the "batch" B<ccm> (where the limit on the arguments of a process
is typically imposed by the operating system). Moreover, it will
silently truncate the command and not signal an error (unless the
truncation causes a syntax error).

=item *

The current method to communicate with the "coprocess" does not allow
for separation of its stdout and stderr.

=item *

C<UseCoprocess> does not work under Win32 at all.

=back

The default value of C<UseCoprocess> is false.

=back

=head2 DESTROY

  $ccm->DESTROY;

Stops the CM Synergy session represented by the session handle
by executing B<ccm stop> (unless the session has the C<KeepSession>
attribut set).

You should never call this method explicitly, as it
is invoked by the Perl runtime when the Perl process exits
(either by calling C<exit> or because of a C<die>).
Hence, a script using the C<VCS::CMSynergy> module will not leave
any CM Synergy sessions hanging around. 

Actually, the Perl runtime will call C<DESTROY> when the last reference
to a session handle goes out of scope, so in the following example
each session will be stopped as soon as one loop through the C<foreach>
body is completed, i.e. there is at most one session in progress
at any one time:

  my @databases = ...;		# a list of CM Synergy databases
  foreach my $db (@databases)
  {
    my $ccm = VCS::CMSynergy->new( database => $db, ... );
    ...
    # perform some operation on $db
    ...
    # session is stopped as "my" variable $ccm is about to go out of scope
  }

Note: The correct way to explicitly stop a session is neither

  $ccm->stop;

nor is it

  $ccm->DESTROY;

Though both forms will execute B<ccm stop>,
the first form makes C<$ccm> a C<VCS::CMSynergy> object with an invalid
RFC address (i.e. attribute CCM_ADDR), while the second form leaves you with an
"empty"  C<VCS::CMSynergy> object. Instead, you should rather say

  $ccm = undef;

=head2 ccm

  ($rc, $out, $err) = $ccm->ccm($command, @args);

This is the workhorse of the VCS::CMSynergy module. It executes B<ccm> 
with command C<$command> and (optional) parameters C<@args>.
In array context it returns a three-element array consisting of
the (operating system) exit code of B<ccm>, and what B<ccm> printed
on stdout and stderr. Note that the exit code is 0 if B<ccm>
operated successfully. On DOSish operating systems the 
(possibly multi-line) strings C<$out> and C<$err> have been read
by Perl in "text" mode, i.e. contain LF characters instead of CRLF.
In any case, C<$out> and C<$err> have been C<chomp>ed.

In scalar context C<ccm> returns the
"logical" exit code, i.e. C<!$rc>, so that you can write:

  $ccm->ccm('checkout', $file_spec) 
      or die "checkout failed: ".$ccm->error;

Note that you must pass every C<ccm> argument or option as a single Perl 
argument. For literal arguments the C<qw()> notation may come in handy, e.g.

  ($rc, $out, $err) = $ccm->ccm(qw(finduse -state working));

Most specialized methods in the VCS::CMSynergy module are ultimately implemented
via the L</ccm> method. Using it directly is only recommended for
commands that perform some action, e.g. B<ccm checkout>, as opposed to 
query-like commands. For the latter, e.g. B<ccm query>, use one of the 
methods that return the information in structured form, 
e.g. L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> or
L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref">, instead of having 
to parse C<$out> yourself.

In fact, there is a shortcut for "action" commands: if you call
a non-existent method on a VCS::CMSynergy object, it tries to invoke
the L</ccm> method with the original method name as the C<$command>
followed by the parameters of the original call, i.e.

  $ccm->checkout($file_spec);

and 

  $ccm->ccm('checkout', $file_spec);

are equivalent (given that there is no real C<checkout> method).
Return values are those of L</ccm> (depending on context).
This is accomplished by a suitable C<AUTOLOAD> method.

=head1 QUERY METHODS

=head2 query

  $ary_ref = $ccm->query(@args);

Executes the B<ccm query> command with the given C<@args> as parameters.
The output (as formatted by the C<-format> option) is split into lines.
These are L<chomp|perlfunc/chomp>ed and a reference to the resulting array
of strings is returned. 

If there a no hits, a reference to an empty
array is returned. (Note that B<ccm query> considers this an error,
but VCS::CMSynergy does not.) 

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

Note that you must pass every B<ccm query> argument or option as a single
Perl argument. For literal arguments the C<qw()> notation may come in handy.
Example:

  $result = $ccm->query(qw(-t csrc -f), '%displayname %modify_time');
  print "$_\n" foreach (@$result);

If you are interested in the value of several attributes for the
result set of the query, you should look at the 
L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> and 
L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> methods that 
return this information in 
structured form. If you are only interested in the identity of
objects in the result set, you should look at the 
L<query_object|/"query_object, query_object_with_attributes"> method.

Note that L</query> will probably produce
unpredictable results when the C<-format> option references attributes
that can have multi-line values, e.g. C<status_log>. 
L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> and
L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> handle this case correctly.

=head2 query_arrayref, query_hashref

  $ary_ref = $ccm->query_arrayref($query, @keywords);
  print "@$_\n" foreach @$ary_ref;

  $ary_ref = $ccm->query_hashref($query, @keywords);
  print "@$_{@keywords}\n" foreach @$ary_ref;

C<query_arrayref> and C<query_hashref>
execute B<ccm query> with the query expression C<$query> asking
for the values of the built-in keywords or attributes supplied
in C<@keywords>. They both return a reference to an array of references,
one per result row. 

C<query_arrayref> represents a row as an array containing
the values of the keywords for that particular object in the result set
(in the order given by C<@keywords>). 

C<query_hashref> represents a row as a hash containing
attribute and value pairs where the keys are the C<@keywords>.

If the query returned no hits, both C<query_arrayref>
and C<query_hashref> return a reference to an empty array.

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

If the value of a keyword or an attribute is undefined or
the attribute is not present, the actual value of the corresponding
array or hash element is C<undef> (whereas B<ccm query> would print it as
the string C<< "<void>" >>).

The following names may also be used as keywords though they
are neither built-in nor attributes:

=over 4

=item C<object>

The value is a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> representing 
the object in the result set.

=item C<finduse>

The value is a reference to a hash identifying in what parts of what
projects the object is used.  A key in the hash is the project's objectname.
The hash value is the
corresponding relative path (including the object's name) in the project.
This information is the same as reported by B<ccm finduse>. In fact, if
this keyword is given, L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> 
and L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref">
invoke B<ccm finduse -query $query> rather than B<ccm query $query>.  
Example:

  my $result = $ccm->query_arrayref(
    "name = 'main.c'", qw(objectname finduse));

returns (as formatted by L<Data::Dumper>):

  $result = [
    [
      'main.c-1:csrc:3',	# objectname
      {				# finduse
	 'guilib-1.0'	=> 'guilib/sources/main.c',
	 'guilib-int'	=> 'guilib/sources/main.c',
	 'guilib-darcy'	=> 'guilib/sources/main.c'
      }
    ],
    ...
  ];

=item C<objectname>

C<objectname> actually I<is> a built-in keyword. However, CM Synergy 
B<ccm query -f %objectname> returns the deprecated I<fullname>
(i.e. C<subsystem/cvtype/name/version>) for certain model objects
(e.g. try B<ccm query -f %objectname -i base>) (but refuses to accept
them as arguments later). Therefore C<VCS::CMSynergy> will rewrite
these I<fullname>s to correct I<objectname>s before returning them
from C<query_arrayref> or C<query_hashref>.

=item C<task_objects>

The value is a reference to an array of C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> 
representing the tasks associated with the object. The value is C<undef>
if there are no associated tasks. This keyword is implemented using
the Synergy built-in keyword "%task".

=item C<cr_objects>

The value is a reference to an array of C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> 
representing the change request associated with the object. 
The value is C<undef> if there are no associated change requests.
This keyword is implemented using 
the Synergy built-in keyword "%change_request".

=item C<baseline_project>

The value is a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Project> 
representing the object's baseline project. The value is C<undef>
if no baseline project exists. This keyword is implemented using
the Synergy built-in keyword "%baseline".

=item C<baseline_object>

The value is a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> 
representing the object's baseline. The value is C<undef>
if the object isn't in a baseline. This keyword is implemented using
the Synergy built-in keyword "%in_baseline".

=back 

Note the following differences from B<ccm query>:

=over 4

=item *
The keyword or attribute names given in C<@keywords> should I<not>
contain a leading C<%>. Example:

  my $result = $ccm->query_hashref("name match '*.c'", 
                                    qw(displayname type modify_time);
  foreach my $row (@$result)
  {
    print "$row->{displayname} last modified at $row->{modify_time}\n";
    ...
  }

=item *

These methods do I<not> support any of the
shortcut query options of the B<ccm query> command, e.g.
B<-o owner> or B<-n name>. However, a different shortcut syntax
is supported, see L</"shortcut query notation">.

=item *

C<$query> may contain newlines to improve the legibility of 
longish queries with whitespace and line breaks. Any whitespace
in C<$query> will be replaced by a single blank before submitting
it to B<ccm query>.

=back

=head2 query_object, query_object_with_attributes

  $ary_ref = $ccm->query_object($query);
  $ary_ref = $ccm->query_object_with_attributes($query, @keywords);

Executes B<ccm query> with the query expression C<$query> 
and returns a reference to an array of C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s 
that satisfy the query.

If there a no hits, a reference to an empty array is returned.  

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

Note: This is a convenience method. It might be implemented 
using C<query_arrayref>:

  sub query_object
  {
    my ($self, $query) = @_;
    my $ary = $self->query_arrayref($query, 'object') or return;
    [ map { $_->[0] } @$ary ];	# project onto first (and only) column
  }

C<query_object_with_attributes> is only useful when
L</:cached_attributes> is in effect. 
It returns the same result as C<query_object>,
but the returned C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s have their attribute caches
primed for the attributes listed in C<@keywords>. You could also
view it as a fancy form of C<query_hashref> where we don't store
the attributes values of C<@keywords> in some anonymous hash,
but rather in the corresponding object. Thus the loop

  for my $obj (@{ $ccm->query_object_with_attributes("...", qw(foo)) })
  {
    print "$obj: foo=", $obj->get_attribute("foo"), "\n";
  }

issues a I<total of one> B<ccm> calls. Note: this example assumes 

  use VCS::CMSynergy qw(:cached_attributes);

=head2 query_count

  $n = $ccm->query_count($query);

Returns the number of objects matched by C<$query>, 0 if nothing matched.
This is the same as 

  scalar @{ $ccm->query_object($query) }

but it's implemented more efficiently (and also less prone to
exhaust the 10 MB query result buffer in the Synergy engine).

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

=head2 shortcut query notation

L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref">, 
L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref">,
L<query_object|/"query_object, query_object_with_attributes">,
L<query_object_with_attributes|/"query_object, query_object_with_attributes"> 
and L</query_count>
support a shortcut notation for their common C<$query> parameter. To use
this shortcut, supply a hash reference for C<$query>
(instead of a simple string):

  $result = $ccm->query_hashref(
    { type => 'csrc', match => '*.cpp' }, qw(objectname status));

Every C<< key => value >> represents a simple query. Simple queries
are combined with AND. The following simple queries are accepted:

=over 4

=item "key" => $scalar

This is translated to CMSynergy query syntax as C<key = '$scalar'>.
Note the quotes around C<$scalar>. However, quotes are omitted
if C<$scalar> is either the string C<"TRUE"> or C<"FALSE">. 
In general, C<key> is the name of an attribute. 
The following keys are treated specially:

=over 4

=item match

C<< match => $scalar >> is short for C<name match '$scalar'>.

=item task

C<< task => $tasknr >> is short for 
C<is_associated_cv_of(cvtype = 'task' and task_number = '$tasknr')>.
This corresponds to CM Synergy's B<ccm query -task tasknr>.

=back

=item "key" => \@array

This is translated as a call of a query function, 
i.e. C<key('$array[0]', ...)>. Quoting is as described above.  Example:

  $ccm->query_object(
    { hierarchy_project_members => 
      [ 'toolkit-1.0:project:1', 'none' ] });

=item "key" => \%hash

This is translated as a call of a query function with a nested query
as parameter: Example:

  $rel = '6.0';
  $ccm->query_object(
    { is_member_of => { release => $rel, match => '*web*' });

gets translated to

  "is_member_of(release='6.0' and name match '*web*')" 

=back

=head2 history

  $ary_ref = $ccm->history(@args);

Executes the B<ccm history> command with the given C<@args> as parameters.
The output (probably formatted by the C<-format> option) is split into 
chunks at the divider line (a line consisting of lots of asterisks).
A reference to the resulting array of (multi-line) strings is returned. 

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

Note that you must pass every B<ccm history> argument or option as a single
Perl argument. For literal arguments the C<qw()> notation may come in handy.

If you are interested in the successor or predecessor or 
certain attributes of an object in the history,
you should look at the L<history_arrayref|/"history_arrayref, history_hashref">
and L<history_hashref|/"history_arrayref, history_hashref">
methods that return this information in structured form. 

=head2 history_arrayref, history_hashref

  $ary_ref = $ccm->history_arrayref($file_spec, @keywords);
  $ary_ref = $ccm->history_hashref($file_spec, @keywords);

C<history_arrayref> and C<history_hashref>
execute B<ccm history> for C<$file_spec> asking
for the values of the built-in keywords or attributes supplied
in C<@keywords>. The both return a reference to an array of references,
one per history entry. 

C<history_arrayref> represents a history entry as an array containing
the values of the keywords for that particular object in the history
(in the order given by C<@keywords>). 

C<history_hashref> represents a history entry as a hash
containing attribute and value pairs where the keys are the C<@keywords>.

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

If the value of a keyword or an attribute is undefined or
the attribute is not present, the actual value of the corresponding
array or hash element is C<undef> (whereas B<ccm history> would print it as
the string C<< "<void>" >>).

The following names may also be used as keywords though they
are neither built-in nor attributes:

=over 4

=item C<predecessors>

The value returned is a reference to an array of C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s
that represent the given object's predecessors.

=item C<successors>

The value returned is a reference to an array of C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s
that represent the given object's successors.

=item C<object>, C<objectname>, C<task_objects>

For these pseudo keywords see the description
of the  L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> 
and  L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> methods.

=back

Note the following differences from B<ccm history>:

=over 4

=item *

Only one C<$file_spec> is allowed.

=item *

There is no C<-p> (project) option. If you want to get the history
of a project use the full objectname of the project for C<$file_spec>.

=item *

The keyword or attribute names given in C<@keywords> should I<not>
contain a leading C<%>. Example:

  my $result = $ccm->history_hashref(
    'math.h-1:incl:1', qw(displayname modify_time successors));

  foreach my $row (@$result)
  {
    print "$row->{displayname}: last modified at $row->{modify_time}\n";
    print "\t$_\n" foreach (@{ $row->{successors} });
    ...
  }

=back

=head2 finduse

  $ary_ref = $ccm->finduse(@args);

Executes the B<ccm finduse> command with the given C<@args> as parameters.
It returns a reference to an array of rows, one per C<file_spec> given
in C<@args>, or one per query result if C<-query $query_expression>
is present in C<@args>. 

Each row is a reference to an array of two elements.  The first
element is the description of the object.  The second element is a
reference to a hash identifying in what parts of what projects the
object is used. 
A key in this hash is the project's objectname 
and the value is the corresponding
relative path in the project.  If there
are no uses of the object in the given scope the hash is empty.  This
usage information is in the same form as that for the pseudo keyword
C<finduse>  of the  L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> 
and  L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> methods.

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned. If an element of C<@args>
refers to a non-existent object, the corresponding element in 
the return value is C<undef>.

Note that you must pass every B<ccm finduse> argument or option as a single
Perl argument. For literal arguments the C<qw()> notation may come in handy.

If you are interested in usage information for all objects matching a
query you should look at the 
L<query_arrayref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref"> and
L<query_hashref|/"query_arrayref, query_hashref">
methods, esp. the C<finduse> keyword.

Example (recreate the output of the B<ccm finduse> command):

  foreach (@{ $ccm->finduse(@args) })
  {
    my ($desc, $uses) = @$_;
    print "$desc\n";
    if (keys %$uses)
    {
	while (my ($proj_vers, $path) = each %$uses)
	{
	  print "\t$path\@$proj_vers\n"
	}
    }
    else
    {
	print "\tObject is not used in scope.\n";
    }
  }

=head2 findpath

  $path = $ccm->findpath($file_spec, $proj_vers);

This is a convenience function. It returns the relative pathname
(including the objects's name) for the object C<$file_spec> within the
project C<$proj_vers>.

Returns C<undef> if C<$file_spec> is not used in C<$proj_vers>
or if C<$file_spec> does not exist.

Example:

  $ccm->findpath("main.c-1:csrc:3", "guilib-darcy"); 

returns 

  "guilib/sources/main.c"

=head2 relations_hashref

  $ccm->relations_hashref(%options);

  $ccm->relations_hashref(
    to              => "bufcolor.c-2:csrc:1",
    from_attributes => [ qw/objecctname status owner/ ]);

Executes B<ccm relate -show ...> where 
C<%options> may contain any of the following keys:

=over 4

=item from => $file_spec, to => $file_spec

Restricts one or both ends of the relation. The option value may
be any C<$file_spec> accepted by CM Synergy including 
a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>.

=item name => $string

Restricts the return value to relations of type C<$string>, 
e.g. C<associated_cv> or C<successor>.

=item from_attributes => \@keywords, to_attributes => \@keywords

The option value is a reference to an array of attributes
that should be retrieved for the "from" and "to" objects
of a relation, resp.

=back

The result is a reference to an array of hashes where each hash
has exactly four keys describing a relation between two objects:

=over 4

=item from

The value describes the "from" object of the relation.

If C<from_attributes> was not specified the value is the
I<objectname> of the "from" object.

If C<from_attributes> was specified the value is a reference 
to a I<hash of attribute names and values>, 
its keys given by C<from_attributes>.

The pseudo keywords C<object> and C<task_objects> (see 
L</"query_arrayref, query_hashref">) may be used in C<from_attributes>.

=item to

The value describes the "to" object of the relation.

The value depends on C<to_attributes> as described for the "from" key.

=item name

The value is name of the relation.

=item create_time

The value is the time the relation was created.

=back

If there a no hits, a reference to an empty array is returned.  

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

=head2 relations_object

  my $relations = $ccm->relations_object(%options);

Executes B<ccm relate -show ...> where 
C<%options> are the same as described for L</relations_hashref>. 

The result is a reference to an array of hashes where each hash
has exactly four keys describing a relation between two objects:

=over 4

=item from, to

The value is a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>. 

=item name

The value is name of the relation.

=item create_time

The value is the time the relation was created.

=back

If there a no hits, a reference to an empty array is returned.  

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

If C<from_attributes> or C<to_attributes> are specified, these
are used as hints to prime the attribute caches of the
"from" or "to" C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s, resp., similar to
L</query_object_with_attributes>. This is only useful when
L</:cached_attributes> is in effect. 

=head2 project_tree

  $hash = $ccm->project_tree(\%options, $project);
  $hash = $ccm->project_tree(\%options, $project1, $project2 ...);

C<project_tree> traverses the given project(s) and constructs a
mapping of path names to project members. It doesn't need a workarea. 
C<$project> may be any project specification (in project-version form,
an objectname or a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>).
C<project_tree> returns a reference to a hash where the keys 
are the (relative workarea) path names of project members. 

If given one project (the first form above),
hash values are C<$project>'s members, given as C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s. 

If given two or more
projects (the second form), a hash value is an array of 
C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s where the first element is the
member of C<$project1> mapped to the path key, the second
element is the member of C<$project2> etc. If there is no
member mapped to a path in a particular project, the corresponding
element in the array is C<undef>. This form of C<project_tree>
may be useful for comparing projects, see below for an example.

If there was an error, C<project_tree> returns C<undef>.

The first argument, C<\%options>, is either C<undef> or a hash reference
of options for project traversal:

=over 4

=item C<subprojects> (boolean)

If this option is true, the mapping will recurse into
subprojects. It is false by default.
It corresponds to the option of the same name for
L<VCS::CMSynergy::Project/traverse>.
If this option is false and C<mark_projects> is also false,
no indication of sub projects is present in the tree;
if C<mark_projects> is true, then the tree will contain 
just the sub project  C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s, but nothing
"below" them.

=item C<attributes> (array ref)

This option is only useful if L</:cached_attributes> is in effect. 
All returned C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s will have their attribute
caches primed for the given attributes. See the description
of the option of the same name for L<VCS::CMSynergy::Project/traverse>.

=item C<pathsep> (string)

Use C<pathsep> as the separator for the path names (the keys of
the returned hash). If you do not specify this, 
C<project_tree> uses the path separator appropriate 
for the operating system the script is running on.

=item C<mark_projects> (boolean)

It decides what will be shown as the value for a path
corresponding to a (sub) project. If false, the value
refers to the (sub) project's top level directory 
(a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> of cvtype "dir").
If true, the value refers to the (sub) project itself
(a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> with cvtype "project").

This option is false by default.

Note that if C<subprojects> is false, this option also decides
whether a path corresponding to a sub project is present in the tree at all.

=back

The following example shows how to compute the "difference" between two
projects expressed in the file system.

  my $tree = $ccm->project_tree(undef, $proj1, $proj2);
  foreach my $path (sort keys %$tree)
  {
    my ($obj1, $obj2) = @{ $tree->{$path} };

    print("added $path: $obj2\n"), next      unless defined $obj1;
    print("deleted $path: $obj1\n"), next    unless defined $obj2;
    print("changed $path: $obj1 -> $obj2\n") unless $obj1 eq $obj2;
  }

=head2 project_diff

  $ccm->project_diff(\%options, $old_project, $new_project, $differ);

C<project_diff> first calls L</project_tree> on C<$old_project>, 
C<$new_project> and then drives C<$differ> using the resulting map.
This is a convenience method for computing the "difference" between
two projects in various forms. See below for a simple example
and L<ccm_project_diff> for a complete working program.

C<$differ> must be an object supporting the following methods:

=over 4

=item C<added($path, $new)>

This is called for every C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> only in C<$new_project>;
arguments are the path and the added object.

=item C<deleted($path, $old)>

This is called for every C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> only in C<$old_project>;
arguments are the path and the deleted object.

=item C<changed($path, $old, $new)>

This is called when the C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s in C<$old_project>
and C<$new_project> at C<$path> are different;
arguments are the path and both objects.

=back

The above methods are mandatory. The following methods are called
when C<$differ> supports them:

=over 4

=item C<identical($path, $obj)>

This is called when the C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s in C<$old_project>
and C<$new_project> at C<$path> are identical;
arguments are the path and the object.

=item C<start($old_project, $new_project)>

This is called before the traversal of the project tree starts; 
arguments are the original C<VCS::CMSynergy::Project>s supplied
to C<project_diff>.

=item C<finish()>

This is called after traversal of the project tree is completed;
no arguments are supplied;
C<project_diff> will return whatever this method returns
(if C<$differ> doesn't support this method, C<project_diff> returns C<undef>).

=back

Methods with a C<$path> argument are called in ascending path sort order,
esp. path children are processeed B<after> their parents.

The first parameter, C<\%options>, is the same as the corresponding
parameter for L</project_tree> and is passed through unchanged
(except for option C<pathsep> which is currently hardwired to "/").
Additionally the following option is recognized:

=over 4

=item C<hide_sub_trees> (boolean)

This option controls the handling of whole added or deleted sub trees.
If it is true, C<$differ>'s C<added> or C<deleted> methods
will only be called for the root of an added or deleted sub tree,
all other calls are suppressed. Otherwise, C<added> or C<deleted> will
be called for any path in the sub tree.

It defaults to false.

=back

The following example prints a simple list of changes between
two projects. All objects are listed with their path in filesystem first;
"deleted" objects are prefixed with "-", "added" objects are prefixed
with "+", different objects at the same path are prefixed with "!",
and ouput for identical objects is suppressed.

  {
    package SimpleDiffer;
    sub new	{ my ($class) = @_; bless {}, $class; }
    sub added	{ my ($self, $path, $new) = @_; 
                  print "+ $path $new\n"; }
    sub deleted	{ my ($self, $path, $old) = @_; 
                  print "- $path $old\n"; }
    sub changed	{ my ($self, $path, $old, $new) = @_; 
	          print "! $path $old $new\n"; }
  }
  ...
  $ccm->project_diff({ hide_sub_trees => 1 }, 
                     $old_project, $new_project, SimpleDiffer->new);

=head1 ATTRIBUTE METHODS

=head2 get_attribute

  $value = $ccm->get_attribute($attr_name, $file_spec);

Get the value of the attribute C<$attr_name> for
C<$file_spec> (using B<ccm attribute -show>). 

If the attribute isn't defined for C<$file_spec>, C<undef> is returned.

If C<RaiseError> is not
set and an error occurs (e.g. object C<$file_spec> doesn't exist), 
C<undef> will be returned.

Note the following differences from B<ccm attribute -show>:

=over 4

=item *

Only one C<$file_spec> is allowed.

=item *

There is no C<-p> (project) option. If you want to get an attribute 
of a project use the full objectname of the project for C<$file_spec>.

=item *

It is I<not> an error to get the value of an attribute that isn't defined
for the particular object. Instead, check the return value of L</get_attribute>
with C<defined> as an attribute's value can never be C<undef>.

=back

=head2 set_attribute

  $ccm->set_attribute($attr_name, $file_spec, $value);

Set the value of the attribute C<$attr_name>
for C<$file_spec> to C<$value> 
(usually using B<ccm attribute -modify>, but see below).

Returns C<$value> on success.  If C<RaiseError>
is not set and an error occurs (e.g. attribute C<$attr_name> does not
exist on object C<$file_spec>), C<undef> will be returned.

This works for B<all> types of attributes, even those of type I<text>
(or derived from I<text>) and with C<$value>s that consist of
multiple lines, have arbitrary length or are empty strings.

Note the following differences from B<ccm attribute -modify>:

=over 4

=item *

If the attribute C<$attr_name>is inherited, 
B<ccm attribute -modify $attr_name> will fail. But C<set_attribute> will
retry with B<ccm attribute -create $attr_name -force> in this case
(thereby converting the attribute to a local attribute). I.e. whenever
L</get_attribute> indicates that an attribute exists (by returning something
C<defined>), you can always set its value with C<set_attribute>
(given you have necessary permissions).

=item *

Only one C<$file_spec> is allowed.

=item *

There is no C<-p> (project) option. If you want to set an attribute 
of a project use the full objectname of the project for C<$file_spec>.

=back

=head2 create_attribute

  $ccm->create_attribute($attr_name, $type, $value, @file_specs);

Create attribute C<$attr_name> of type C<$type> on all objects
given by C<@file_specs> (using B<ccm attribute -create>).
You must specify an initial value (something other than C<undef>) as C<$value>.

Returns true on success and C<undef> on failure.

Note the following differences from B<ccm attribute -create>:

=over 4

=item *

The initial value is mandatory.

=item *

There is no C<-p> (project) option. If you want to set an attribute 
of a project use the full objectname of the project for C<$file_spec>.

=back

=head2 delete_attribute

  $ccm->delete_attribute($attr_name, @file_specs);

Delete attribute C<$attr_name> from all objects
given by C<@file_specs> (using B<ccm attribute -delete>).

Returns true on success and C<undef> on failure.

Note the following differences from B<ccm attribute -create>:

=over 4

=item *

There is no C<-p> (project) option. If you want to set an attribute 
of a project use the full objectname of the project for C<$file_spec>.

=back

=head2 copy_attribute

  $ccm->copy_attribute($attr_name, $from_file_spec, @to_file_specs);
  $ccm->copy_attribute($attr_name, $flags, $from_file_spec, @to_file_specs);

Copy attribute C<$attr_name> from C<$from_file_spec>
by objects given by C<@to_file_specs> (using B<ccm attribute -copy>).

Returns true on success and C<undef> on failure.

You can specify multiple attributes to copy by passing
a reference to an array of attribute names as C<$attr_name>.

The optional C<$flags> must be reference to an array containing
a subset of the following strings: C<"append">, C<"subproj">,
C<"suball">, e.g.

  $ccm->copy_attribute($attr_name, [ qw(subproj suball) ], 
  	               "proja-1.0:project:1", "projb-1.0:project:1");

Cf. the CM Synergy documentation on the I<attribute command>
for the meaning of these flags.

Note the following differences from B<ccm attribute -copy>:

=over 4

=item *

There is no C<-p> (project) option. If you want to set an attribute 
of a project use the full objectname of the project for C<$file_spec>.

=back

=head2 list_attributes

  $hash_ref = $ccm->list_attributes($file_spec);

Lists all attributes for C<$file_spec> (using B<ccm attribute -la>).

Returns a reference to a hash containing pairs of attribute name
and attribute type (e.g. C<string>, C<time>).
Returns C<undef> in case of error.

Note the following differences from B<ccm attribute -la>:

=over 4

=item *

Only one C<$file_spec> is allowed.

=back

=head2 property

  $value = $ccm->property($keyword, $file_spec);
  $hash = $ccm->property(\@keywords, $file_spec);

The first form returns the value of property C<$keyword> for C<$file_spec>
(using B<ccm properties -f ...>). The second form returns the values
of all properties in C<@keywords> as a hash reference.

You can use any of the CM Synergy built-in keywords for C<$keyword> or
C<@keywords>.  If the value of a keyword is undefined, C<undef> is returned
(whereas B<ccm properties> would print it as the string C<< "<void>" >>).

=head1 MISCELLANEOUS METHODS

=head2 cat_object

  $contents = $ccm->cat_object($object);
  $ccm->cat_object($object, $destination);

Retrieves the contents (the "source" in CM Synergy terminology)
of an object without the need for a workarea using B<ccm cat>. 

For both forms above, C<$object> must be a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>.
The first form returns the object's contents as a string (and
C<undef> on error). The second form "writes" the object's contents
to C<$destination> which can be any of the following:

=over 4

=item scalar

the contents will be written into a file named C<$destination>

=item SCALAR reference

the contents will be written into the buffer (string) C<$$destination> 

=item ARRAY reference

the contents will be split into lines and assiged to C<@$destination> 

=item CODE reference

the contents will be split into lines and C<&$destination> will be
called for each line (with the line as the single argument)

=item file handle or GLOB reference

the contents will be written (C<print>ed) onto the file handle

=back

Note the following differences from B<ccm cat>:

=over 4

=item *

C<cat_object> works for binary objects even in CM Synergy versions
before 6.3. (In older versions, B<ccm cat> did I<not> return the actual
contents when invoked on a binary object. Instead it returned the
name of a cache file on the CM Synergy server with the contents.
This was pretty useless unless your program was running directly
on the CM Synergy server.)

=item *

C<cat_object> only accepts a single C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>
as argument

=back

=head2 types

  @types = $ccm->types;

Returns an array of types using B<ccm show -types>.

=head2 migrate_auto_rules

  @mars = $ccm->migrate_auto_rules;

Uses B<ccm show -migrate_auto_rules> to return an array
of arrays (of three elements each), e.g.

  @mars = (
    [ 'MAP_FILE_TO_TYPE',   '.*\\.xml$',       'xml'             ],
    [ 'MAP_FILE_TO_TYPE',   '.*\\.o$',         'relocatable_obj' ],
    [ 'MAP_TYPE_TO_IGNORE', 'relocatable_obj', 'TRUE'            ],
    ...);

=head2 ls

  $ary_ref = $ccm->ls(@args);

Executes the B<ccm ls> command with the given C<@args> as parameters.
The output (as formatted by the C<-format> option) is split into lines.
These are L<chomp|perlfunc/chomp>ed and a reference to the resulting array
of strings is returned. 

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

Note that you must pass every B<ccm ls> argument or option as a single
Perl argument. 

If you are interested to obtain the value of several attributes,
you should look at the L</ls_arrayref>
and L</ls_hashref> methods that return this information in 
structured form. If you are only interested in the identity of
the listed objects, you should look at the L</ls_object> method.

=head2 ls_object

  $ary_ref = $ccm->ls_object($file_spec);

Lists information about a file or the contents of a directory
using the work area name C<$file_spec>.
Returns a reference to an array of corresponding C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>s.
The default C<$file_spec> is the working directory.

=head2 ls_arrayref

  $ary_ref = $ccm->ls_arrayref($file_spec, @keywords);

Lists the values of the built-in keywords or attributes supplied
in C<@keywords> for a file or the contents of a directory
Returns a reference to an array of references,
one per result row. Each reference points to an array containing
the values of the keywords for that particular object
(in the order given by C<@keywords>). 

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

If the value of a keyword or an attribute is undefined or
the attribute is not present, the actual value of the corresponding
array element is C<undef> (whereas B<ccm ls> would print it as
the string C<< "<void>" >>).

Note that the keyword or attribute names given in C<@keywords> should I<not>
contain a leading C<%>. Example:

  my $result = $ccm->ls('foo', qw(displayname type modify_time);
  foreach my $row (@$result)
  {
    my ($displayname, $type, $modify_time) = @$row;
    print "$displayname ($type) last modified at $modify_time\n";
    ...
  }

=head2 ls_hashref

  $ary_ref = $ccm->ls_hashref($file_spec, @keywords);

Lists the values of the built-in keywords or attributes supplied
in C<@keywords> for a file or the contents of a directory
using the work area name C<$file_spec>.
Returns a reference to an array of references,
one per result row. Each reference points to hash containing
attribute and value pairs where the keys are C<@keywords>.

If there was an error, C<undef> is returned.

If the value of a keyword or an attribute is undefined or
the attribute is not present, the actual value of the corresponding
hash element is C<undef> (whereas B<ccm ls> would print it as
the string C<< "<void>" >>).

Note that the keyword or attribute names given in C<@keywords> should I<not>
contain a leading C<%>. Example:

  my $result = $ccm->ls_hashref('foo', qw(displayname type modify_time);
  foreach my $row (@$result)
  {
    print "$row->{displayname} last modified at $row->{modify_time}\n";
    ...
  }

=head2 set

  $value = $ccm->set($option);
  $old_value = $ccm->set($option, $new_value);
  $hash_ref = $ccm->set;

Get or set the value of an option.

In the first form, C<set> returns the value of C<$option>. 
If the option is unset, C<undef> is returned 
(whereas B<ccm set> would print C<"(unset)"> in this case).

In the second form, the C<$option> is set to C<$new_value>, the previous
value is returned. If C<$new_value> is C<undef>, C<$option> is unset.

In the third form, a reference to a hash is returned. The hash consists
of all currently defined options as keys and their respective values.

=head2 ccm_with_text_editor

  ($rc, $out, $err) = $ccm->ccm_with_text_editor($text_value, @cmd);

This is a convenience functions for executing a command 
that is sensitive to the value of the session option C<text_editor>.

C<ccm_with_text_editor> is useful in scripting B<ccm> commands
like B<ccm users>. These commands usually open a temporary file
generated by CM Synergy in a user-specified editor. Then the user edits 
the contents and save her changes. Finally, CM Synergy reads back 
the temporary file and does something with the (changed) contents. 

C<ccm_with_text_editor> does the following

creates a temporary file (using L<File::Temp::tempfile>), 
say C</tmp/a5Xghd>, and writes the string C<$text_value> into it,

=item *

saves the old value of C<text_editor> and sets it to (on Unix)

  "cp /tmp/a5Xghd %filename"

=item *

executes

  $ccm->ccm(@cmd)

which causes CM Synergy to accept C<$text_value> as the "updated value"
w.r.t. to command C<@cmd>,

=item *

restores the value oc C<text_editor>

=item *

finally removes the temporary file.

=back

C<ccm_with_text_editor> returns the same
value as the inner L</ccm> method, except when there is an error setting
the new C<$value> of C<$option>.

=head2 get_releases, set_releases

  $releases = $ccm->get_releases;
  $ccm->set_releases($releases);

C<get_releases> fetches the release table (of active releases) as printed
by B<ccm releases -show>. It returns a reference to a hash where
each  key is the release name and the value is (a reference to) 
a list of included releases, e.g. as formatted by L<Data::Dumper>:

  $releases = {
      '1.0'	=> [ qw(1.0) ],
      '1.1'	=> [ qw(1.0 1.1) ],
      '2.0'	=> [ qw(1.0 1.1 2.0) ],
      '2.0_SP1'	=> [ qw(1.0 1.1 2.0 2.0_SP1) ],
      '2.1'	=> [ qw(1.0 1.1 2.0 2.1) ],
      '3.0'	=> [ qw(1.0 1.1 2.0 2.1 3.0) ],
      '3.1'	=> [ qw(1.0 1.1 2.0 2.1 3.0 3.1) ]
  };

C<set_releases> updates the release table. It takes a reference to
a hash with the same structure as returned by C<get_releases>.

Note: This methods I<do not work> on CM Synergy 6.3 and higher,
because the B<releases> command has been superceded by the 
incompatible, though more powerful, B<release> command.

=head2 ccm_addr

  print "CCM_ADDR=", $ccm->ccm_addr;

Returns the session's RFC address.

=head2 database

  $database = $ccm->database;

Returns the database path (as reported by B<ccm ps>).
The path is in canonical form (i.e. with a trailing C<"/db">).

=head2 delimiter

  $delim = $ccm->delimiter;

Returns the database delimiter.

=head2 dcm_enabled

Returns whether the database is DCM enabled.

=head2 dcm_delimiter

  $delim = $ccm->dcm_delimiter;

Returns the DCM delimiter.

=head2 dcm_database_id

  $dcm_id = $ccm->dcm_database_id;

Returns the DCM database id (B<ccm dcm -show -database_id>) or
the empty string if the database isn't DCM enabled.

=head2 user

Returns the session user (as reported by B<ccm ps>).

=head2 default_project_instance

  $instance  = $ccm->default_project_instance;

Returns the default instance for projects. Use it if you want to complete
a project spec that only consists of the project's name and version:

  $proj_spec .= ":project:" . $ccm->default_project_instance
    unless $proj_spec =~ /:project:/;

In versions of CM Synergy prior to 6.3 this is always C<"1">. 
In newer versions it is C<"1"> if the database isn't DCM enabled,
otherwise it is 

    $ccm->dcm_database_id . $ccm->dcm_delimiter . "1"

=head2 ping

  if ($ccm->ping) { ... }

C<ping> tests whether session C<$ccm> is still alive 
(without causing an exception if it fails).

This could be used e.g. from a web application that keeps a pool
of established CM Synergy sessions to deal with user requests:
before invoking a command on a session the application must make
sure that the session is still valid. If not, it will automatically
create a new session.

=head2 object

  $obj1 = $ccm->object($objectname);
  $obj2 = $ccm->object($name, $version, $cvtype, $instance);

Create a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> from either an I<objectname>
(sometimes called "object reference form" in CM Synergy documentation)
in "name-version:cvtype:instance" format or the four parts specified
separately. 

This is just a wrapper for L<VCS::CMSynergy::Object/new>.
However, C<new> requires the four parts of the I<objectname>
to be specified as separate arguments.

Note that no check is made whether the corresponding object really exists
in the database, use L<VCS::CMSynergy::Object/exists> for that.

=head2 folder_object, task_object, cr_object, baseline_object, project_object

  $folder_obj = $ccm->folder_object("123");
  $task_obj = $ccm->task_object("456#mydb");
  $cr_obj = $ccm->cr_object("42");		# SYNERGY/Change
  $baseline_obj = $ccm->baseline_object("toolkit_2.0_INT_1");
  $proj_obj = $ccm->project_object("toolkit-darcy");

Create a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> (with cvtype "folder",
"task", "problem" or "baseline" resp.) from the I<displayname>
of a folder, task, problem (a.k.a. change request) or baseline,
resp. (The displayname is typically a number or a number followed
by the DCM database_id). 

C<project_object> similarly creates a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Project> from the
displayname ("project spec") of a project; it also accepts the complete
objectname of a project.

Note: These methods work without querying the database.

=head2 object_other_version

  $obj2 = $ccm->object_other_version($obj1, $version);

Returns a new C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> with the same
name, cvtype and instance as C<$obj1> (which must be 
C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>), but with the version C<$version>.

=head2 object_from_cvid

  $obj = $ccm->object_from_cvid($cvid, @keywords);

Returns the C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> corresponding to the
cvid C<$cvid> (the internal primary identifier of a CM Synergy object).
If the cvid doesn't exist, C<undef> is returned. 

This is handy, for example, when you're parsing certain CM Synergy 
log files that contain only the cvid and you want to identify 
the corresponding object.

The optional list of C<@keywords> may be used to prime the
attribute cache of the returned C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>
(similar to the L</query_object> method).

Note: C<object_from_cvid> is implemented by something like

  $ccm->property(objectname => "\@=$cvid")

=head2 object_from_proj_ref

  $obj = $ccm->object_from_proj_ref($path, $proj_spec, @keywords);

Returns the C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> identified by
workarea path C<$path> in project C<$proj_spec>.
If no such object exists, C<undef> is returned. 

C<$proj_spec> can be either a string (a Synergy "proj_spec") or
a C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>.

C<$path> can be either a string (a workarea-relative path, using the
platforms native path separator) or an array ref of path components.

The optional list of C<@keywords> may be used to prime the
attribute cache of the returned C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object>
(similar to the L</query_object> method).

Note: C<object_from_proj_ref> is implemented by something like

  $ccm->property(objectname => "$path\@$proj_spec")

=head2 base_admin, base_model, cs_admin, dcm_admin, cvtype, attype

    $model = $ccm->base_model;
    $project_type = $ccm->cvtype("project");

These are convenience methods for dealing with CM Synergy objects
used to access the database model:

=over 4

=item C<base_admin>, C<base_model>, C<cs_admin>, C<dcm_admin>

These return the C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> corresponding to the model objects:

  base-1:admin:base
  base-1:model:base
  cs-1:admin:1			# SYNERGY/Change enabled databases only
  dcm-1:admin:dcm

=item C<cvtype>, C<attype>

  $ccm->cvtype("foo")
  $ccm->attype("foo")

These return the C<VCS::CMSynergy::Object> corresponding to the model objects:

  foo-1:cvtype:base
  foo-1:attype:base

=back

=head1 METHODS INHERITED FROM C<VCS::CMSynergy::Client>

C<VCS::CMSynergy> is derived from L<VCS::CMSynergy::Client>,
hence the following methods are inherited from the latter:

=over 4

=item C<ccm_home>

=item C<error>, C<set_error>

=item C<ccm_command>, C<out>, C<err>

=item C<trace>, C<trace_msg>

=item C<version>

=item C<ps>

=item C<status>

=back

Note: All these methods can be invoked on a session object
or as class methods.
